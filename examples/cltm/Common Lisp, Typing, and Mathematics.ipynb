    "## Introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Lisp is seldom used by mathematicians and this is an anomaly. The high level of quality of Common Lisp comes from a simple reason: Common Lisp is a *mathematical* object, certainly one of the most beautiful and *potentially* productive existing at this time. Common Lisp is a descendant of the fantastic $\\lambda$-calculus, designed by Church to produce one of the deepest *mathematical* results of the last century, namely the negative answer to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem (\"decision problem\"): no algorithm can determine whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true, false or undecidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, by a quite indirect route, $\\lambda$-calculus became a fascinating programming language, Lisp. Lisp's birth is old, at the end of the fifties, and forty years later it is clear it remains the most advanced \"common\" programming language, \"common\" meaning *with an ANSI norm*, in this case the $\\ldots$ Common Lisp norm. The Common Lisp language is so advanced that it is not so easy to use it for serious applications: a reasonable lucidity about its complex and far-reaching structure is required; so that the initiation stage in the learning process of this language is a little hard. The present paper is a tutorial to introduce *mathematicians* to the main components of Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp. The extraordinary work of Guy Steele and his X3J13 committee during the years 1980-1994 led to a powerful language, on one hand, but on the other hand taking seriously account of standard *practical constraints* in *actual* programming work. Common Lisp is now widely used for complex industrial applications, mainly because of the powerful *dynamic* tools that are available; but it is not used very much for scientific applications, in particular for mathematical applications, and this must be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "No *concrete* language can be completely formalized, but the mathematical precision of the definition of Common Lisp gives its user much security, the precision which is required for sophisticated mathematical applications, in particular when complicated data-sharing arrangements are necessary. Another aspect of Common Lisp is without any equivalent with the other languages: the user may *freely* design his application at the best programming level, sometimes at a very high level, directly handling rich and complex mathematical structures; for example it is explained in [Section 5.2](#Kenzo-classes.) that three simple lines of Lisp code are sufficient to explain to the machine that a simplicial group is simultaneously a Kan space and a Hopf algebra, sharing a common graded differential coalgebra structure, but with some added data, namely two simplicial morphisms describing the simplicial group structure. Other times, in the *same* program, you may on the contrary work at a very low level, in an assembler-like style. The language is carefully *stratified* to help the developer to remain lucid and at ease about these questions. The Common Lisp *macro generator*, without any equivalent in other common languages, allows also the programmer to easily use his low level code when he is on the contrary working at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is a good element for appreciation is the ability of a language to be quickly adapted to new *mandatory* evolutions; at this time, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) must be integrated in a language claimed *common*, and Common Lisp succeeded in doing it so nicely that it can even be used to *describe* what OOP exactly is. The CLOS (Common Lisp Object\n",
    "System) chapter of [[STEL2]](#STEL2) is one of the most amazing parts of Computer Science. The general *dynamic* feature of Common Lisp has in particular been kept: the user may dynamically change the class of his objects; he may also redefine dynamically the classes without loosing the objects of this class; and the user may freely decide exactly what happens for these objects. If this is not yet flexible enough, the Metaobject Protocol (MOP), not yet ormalized, but already widely used, allows our user to freely define his own OP system; CLOS is in fact only a particular application of MOP, see [[KCRB]](#KCRB).\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is devoted to a few didactical examples to help mathematicians to understand how Common Lisp and more precisely CLOS can be used for mathematical applications. It is organized as follows. Firstly, a small set of artificial examples is used to explain the general structure of CLOS. The main work in OOP, and certainly the most difficult one, is at the initialization stage of the instances (objects). Even if a user does not intend to use the current Common-Lisp, studying how the initialization process is designed in this environment will explain to him the good points of view in this domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a more significant example is described to show the actual workstyle when CLOS is used in a non-beginner job. Because the OOP subject is strongly related to *typing*, a possible description of what typing *could be* is used as a theme of an exercise showing how CLOS allows to implement the consequences of this description. This example is very simple and should be a good tutorial to simultaneously understand the initial points of OOP under Common Lisp and what typing is, at least from the point of view of the *actual* programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section is more mathematically oriented: it is explained how the basic mathematical *categories*, sets, magmas and monoids, can be directly implemented in CLOS, without meeting any kind of difficulty. The possibility for the Lisp user to arbitrarily mix OOP and high level functional programming (lexical closures) gives at once the required tools. The specialized programming environments such as Axiom, Gap, Magma $\\ldots$ so can be skipped and the mathematician may freely work at an arbitrary level *in the programming language itself*, keeping a perfect control of the environment, without being bothered by a restrictive environment, seldom well-adjusted to an arbitrary new *research* work.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the case of the author and his colleagues when the central problems of Algebraic Topology were considered from a computational point of view [[SRGR3]](#SRGR3)[[RBSR6]](#RBSR6). The resulting Lisp program Kenzo [[DRSS]](#DRSS) shows a concrete example of use of CLOS for a relatively large implementation work[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote_1). The Kenzo program is not at all didactic, it is an actual program able to produce mathematical results that are unreachable otherwise. Some points of the experience acquired by Kenzo's authors are discussed in the last section and in this way the reader will see a few more concrete points of CLOS.\n",

    "\n",
    "## CLOS (= Common Lisp Object System).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, the notion of *Common Lisp Object System*, CLOS in short, does not make sense anymore. The first definition of Common Lisp, known as Common-Lisp-1984 [[STEL1]](#STEL1), did not have any \"object system\". Typing was already strong in CL-1984, at least if wished by the user; standard types were defined and the initial type system was freely extendable by the user, but the now classical notions of *classes*, *instances*, *generic functions* and *methods* were not yet available. The pre-ANSI version of Common Lisp, namely Common-Lisp-1990, contained a *proposal* for an OOP system, called Common Lisp Object System [Ch. 28, pp 770-864 [STEL2]](#STEL2); the pre-versions of this object system were already widely used at this time by the Lisp programmers. Finally, the ANSI specification [[ANSI]](#ANSI) of Common Lisp (1994) completely integrated the so-called Common Lisp Object System in the very definition of the language. The standard Lisp programmer is now assumed working according to the spirit of OOP, constantly using classes, instances of classes, methods and so on, like in C++ or Java[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote_2). But the perfect integration of the general ideas of OOP with the so powerful Common Lisp gives its user many capabilities which are at this time outside of scope with other languages, mainly when *functional programming* is involved. However we continue to call CLOS the part of the ANSI Common Lisp language devoted to OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "This object system in Common Lisp coexists with the old typing system and also the old *structure* system, which allowed the user to define, construct and use the classical *record* objects, with several fields, typed or not. From a hierarchical point of view, the typing system and the structure system are *subsystems* of the object system: special predefined classes correspond to the main classical data types, and the same for the structured objects. But normaly the current Lisp programmer mainly works with the object system, organizing his workspace in classes, subclasses, methods and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Common Lisp object system is elegant and powerful. As usual in Common Lisp, it is organized so that the user keeps a very large freedom. A *standard style* is carefully designed, but the user may go far from this standard style if special situations are encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='footnote_2'><sup>2</sup></a> With a slightly different terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A quick comparison with C++ and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few indications are given in this section about the main OOP features of Java, C++ and CLOS. In Java, the classes are \"above\" the methods (member functions): the specific functions for a class are defined *inside this class* so that the class and member function hierarchies are more or less *parallel*. This leads sometimes to artificial classes, typically the `System` class and the `Math` class, when this *rule* becomes non-sense in particular situations. The *member functions* are available under C++ too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++ you may also *overload* the functions, in particular the member functions. There are no member functions in CLOS[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote_3), there is only an overloading feature. But three other features are provided by CLOS which make particularly convenient and elegant the developer work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initialization process of the objects is essential in OOP; the general CLOS organisation of this work is really wonderful, in particular conceptually very simple, leading the programmer towards the good points of view, see [Section 2.3](#Initializing-instances.) for a small introduction to this point.\n",
    "- The *method qualifiers* give much flexibility to organize the work of all the *applicable* methods; numerous simple examples in this paper.\n",
    "- The functional basis of Common Lisp allows the user to easily install *functional slots* (members) of any sort, in particular *compiled closure slots*, dramatically extending the programming scope; [Section 4](#CLOS-and-Mathematical-Structures.) gives striking applications of this feature; in particular the instances may be themselves *funcallable*, in other words the instances become also functional objects, see [Section 3](#What-typing-is.) for a typical illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CLOS, the *basic ingredients* are clearly distinguished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *class system*, mainly used through the `defclass` statement, allows the user to define the structure of his *instances* (objects), in particular through the notion of *subclass* (derived class).\n",
    "- The *function type* is *primitive*; a function is an object which can be *funcalled* (called) for some work about some *arguments*.\n",
    "- The *packaging system* allows the developer to precisely define what parts of his source code are normally directly known and/or reachable by a user of his program, obtaining in particular the equivalent of the `private` C++ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if the *class system* and the *functional* organization of Common Lisp are to be simultaneously considered, the particular notions of *generic functions* and *methods* must be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *generic function* is a functional object the exact work of which will depend on the class of its arguments.\n",
    "- The code for *some* specific work of a generic function corresponding to *some* particular class distribution of its arguments and *some qualifier* is a *method* object; each method is defined by a `defmethod` statement.\n",
    "- In general *several* methods are involved when a *generic function* is invoked, they are called the *applicable* methods. CLOS gives its user a large freedom to organize these methods with respect to each other, to cover any possible situation, in particular when a sophisticated chronology of their work is required. This feature has no equivalent in C++ or Java, this is obtained by the *method qualifiers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the CLOS *methods* can be thought of arranged in a *three*-dimensional array where each entry is associated to a generic function, the first index, the class distribution of the parameters, the second index, and the method qualifier, the third index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLOS method qualifiers have no equivalent in C++ or Java; a predefined qualifier organization is provided, already rather rich, sufficient for most of the ordinary cases[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote_4). If still more sophisticated combinations of methods are required, the `define-method-combination` function allows the developer to freely extend this organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, and this will be detailed in [Section 4](#CLOS-and-Mathematical-Structures.), a mathematician who installs under CLOS the traditional mathematical categories must organize his work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `defclass` statements will be used to define what a *set* object is, what a *group* object is, what a *chain complex* object is, and so on.\n",
    "- The `defgeneric` statements will be used to define functions working on these objects, but these \"functions\" are traditionnally called in this case *functors* in mathematics; therefore one `defgeneric` statement for the *sum* functor, another *defgeneric* for the *product* functor, another `defgeneric` for the *classifying space* functor, and so on.\n",
    "- Finally each generic function will have various methods to adapt the generic function to specific cases; for example the product of two objects of some category is also an object of this category with the corresponding structure to be defined. Therefore one product method for the *sets*, another product method for the *magmas*, another product method for the *monoids*, and so on. The `call-next-method` and `change-class` functions will allow these methods to *possibly* refer to the *less specific* ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='footnote_3'><sup>3</sup></a> A C++ or Java member function is nothing but a CLOS generic function where the first argument is given *before* the function reference, with an implicit `with-slots` for this particular argument; such a feature can be easily added to the environment with the Metaobject Protocol; in general CLOS prefers to keep the maximal symmetry between the critical arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='footnote_4'><sup>4</sup></a> For example quite sufficient for the Kenzo program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Very simple CLOS examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be defined with the traditional hierarchy and methods may be defined which will be called, or not, according to the argument classes. The general `call-next-method` function allows the user to invoke shadowed methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote_5) a simple class `C1` and a subclass `C2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='footnote_5'><sup>5</sup></a> In the original paper, the small Lisp examples showed for illustration have really been run under Allegro Common Lisp and may be repeated under any ANSI Common Lisp; the Lisp prompt is here '`>`'; the maltese cross $\\maltese$ corresponds to the `<Return>` key asking for the evaluation of the typed-in statement; usually the symbols are keyed in lower case, and Lisp displays the answers with upper case."

    "Again it is interesting to deduce from this example the chronology of the calls of the five user-defined `print-object` methods.

    "\n",
    "It is well known the main part and the main difficulties of the OOP job are in the initialization work for the instances. Let us examine the general organization of the CLOS initialization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential components of the initialization process in CLOS are the following generic functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *standard* `make-instance` allocates the memory space for the instance to be created and calls `initialize-instance` to initialize it;\n",
    "- The *standard* `initialize-instance` in fact calls `shared-initialize` to do the initialization work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of `shared-initialize` is the following. Frequently the initialization work to be done is essentially the same when an instance is created, or *re*initialized, or when its class is changed, or finally when the underlying class is itself redefined. If possible, the user is advised to define this common work in `shared-initialize` methods. If on the contrary there are significant differences between these cases, the user may write particular methods for the following generic functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](the-main-initialization-generic-functions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `initialize-instance`: called by `make-instance` to initialize a just created instance; the user can extend and/or modify the standard initialization by writing specific methods for some classes.\n",
    "- `reinitialize-instance`: called by the user when he wants to \"refresh\" some instance; sometimes it is the same as initializing from scratch, sometimes not; in the first case it is better to write an appropriate `shared-initialize` method; in the second case, the user must write specific methods for `reinitialize-instance`.\n",
    "- `change-class`: called by the user when the class of an instance is *changed*; this function asks for a kind of conversion. Normally this function calls the generic function `update-instance-for-different-class` and the user may write methods for the latter. A simple example follows.\n",
    "- `defclass`: if a `defclass` is in fact a *redefinition* of the class, each time an instance of the old version is considered,  the generic function `update-` `instance-for-redefined-class` is applied, allowing in principle to coherently continue the work.\n",
    "- `make-instance`: the user can also entirely redefine the creation and initialization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing appropriate methods for these generic functions, the user can freely define the initialization work, clearly distinguishing the various levels from each other; if sufficient, the programmer may partially or totally use the *standard style* without any further work. You understand that combining these methods with the user-defined class hierarchy, combining also with the various possibilities of *auxiliary methods* (`:before`, `:after`, `:around`), the user has a fantastically large workspace. However, once this structure is reasonably understood, it is not difficult to be used, and quickly very powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The example of `change-class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various situations that are met in the artificial simple example of this section around the `change-class` generic function allow to easily understand the general CLOS organisation of the initialization work."

    "## What typing is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The small examples of the previous section were artificial, and we want to consider now a *plausible* situation. We want to use CLOS to implement a simple coherent *typing system*, allowing the user to simultaneously use arbitrary types and high levels of *functional programming*, both subjects being furthermore strongly dependent on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is typing? If a *mathematical* definition of typing is wished, many definitions are possible, and one of them is to be illustrated by a small CLOS program. Note this *new* typing system will be installed while the standard one remains active in our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing consists in giving the programmer the ability of *partial* descriptions of his algorithms. Let us call $\\mathcal{A}$ the *universe* of all the machine objects, $\\mathcal{A}$ for <u>a</u>nything. Any algorithm can be viewed as a map $\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A}$ *not everywhere defined*. Typically the Euclid algorithm is defined on the set $\\mathbb{N}_* \\times \\mathbb{N}_*$ of pairs of positive integers, and returns such an integer. The set $\\mathbb{N}_*$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{A}$, and the latter contains also the set $\\mathcal{L}$ of lists of any length; among these lists, some of them are made of two positive integers; let us call $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{N}_* , \\mathbb{N}_*)$ the corresponding subtype. The type specification (signature) for the Euclid algorithm $E$ is then $E: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{N}_* , \\mathbb{N}_*) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}_*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking so, we have used a few subsets of $\\mathcal{A}$. Such a simple example could create some wrong ideas. On one hand, one could think two different types should be disjoint, but it is not the case for $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{N}_* , \\mathbb{N}_*)$. If not disjoint, one could then require one of the considered types is included in the\n",
    "other one; for example $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{N}_* , \\mathbb{N}_*) \\subset \\mathcal{L}$ and it seems sensible to organize the types as a large *oriented graph* describing more and more finely the various sets of objects the user works with. Simple typing systems usually are of this sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea has a much larger scope; it consists in deciding a type is nothing but some subset of $\\mathcal{A}$, where the *membership property* may be verified by an algorithm. In other words we start only with two predefined types, $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$; the second one, the *Boolean* type, has only two objects, $\\top$ and $\\bot$, implemented in Lisp as the symbols `T` and `NIL`. It is then interesting to define a type as an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$ *everywhere* defined; in other words, the algorithm defining a type has the special signature $\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sufficient in simple programming, but fails as soon as functional programming must be considered. In fact we meet the Russell paradox or if you prefer the G&#246;del theorem. Let us call $\\mathcal{T}$ the type of ... types, that is the set of functional objects $\\alpha:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$. Then no algorithm can verify the membership of $\\mathcal{T}$! Let us assume $\\tau$ is such an algorithm; therefore $\\tau:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$ is everywhere defined and $\\tau(\\alpha) = \\top$ if and only if $\\alpha$ defines a type, that is, $\\alpha:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$ is also everywhere defined. Then one could design the subtype $\\mathcal{T}'$ made of the algorithms $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $\\alpha(\\alpha) = \\bot$, in other words the type of \"typing algorithms\" $\\alpha$ that are *not* \"element\" of the type associated with $\\alpha$. It would be easy to write down the algorithm $\\tau'$ corresponding to the new type $\\mathcal{T}'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcll}\n",

    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm $\\tau'$ firstly examines whether its argument $\\alpha$ is an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$; if yes, the algorithm $\\alpha$ may work on any object, in particular on itself, and $\\tau'$ returns the opposite of $\\alpha(\\alpha)$; otherwise the answer is negative. Once the algorithm $\\tau:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$ is available, then the object $\\tau':\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{B}$ is available too, but Cantor and Russell remarked there is no possible answer for $\\tau'(\\tau')$: the answer of $\\tau(\\tau')$ should certainly be $\\top$, so that we obtain the contradictory relation $\\tau'(\\tau') = \\mathtt{not}\\ \\tau'(\\tau')$. Therefore the algorithm $\\tau$ may not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional (pseudo-) solution for this difficult problem consists in *delaying* the examination of the type of functional objects. If an object $\\alpha$ is claimed to be an algorithm $\\mathcal{T}_1\\rightarrow\\mathcal{T}_2$, this\n",
    "cannot be verified by a *general* algorithm; instead, we must *wait* for an actual run of the algorithm $\\alpha$: if the computation of $\\alpha(\\omega)$ is asked for, some process can *then* verify the argument $\\omega$ is really in the type $\\mathcal{T}_1$; if yes the computation of $\\alpha(\\omega)$ is started and the result $\\omega'$ is examined in turn, verifying the relation $\\omega' \\in\\mathcal{T}_2$. In other words it is not possible to verify the type of a functional object *in general*; the only possible verification consists, each time the algorithm works, in verifying that the argument and the result have the correct type; this \"verification\" is not at all complete, it can be applied only to a finite number of calls of the algorithm $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This organization must be recursive: the source and/or target types could in turn be functional, so that the verifications $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\\omega' \\in \\mathcal{T}_2$ maybe must also be \"delayed\" with the meaning just explained. In particular if $\\omega$ and $\\omega'$ are both functional, then the functional object $\\omega$ *will* probably *be* used when the object $\\omega'$ will work. It is only at this time the correctness of the claimed types for $\\omega$, at least for this particular use, may be verified. Examples of this sort are showed in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, when a whole program is executed, all the *particular uses* of the functional objects imply that the type of arguments and result are verified, so that when the program is finished, for all the invocations of functional objects, types of input and output are confirmed. Thinking a little about this situation finally leads to the following conclusion: as far as they have been used, the type rules about functional objects have been satisfied *for this specific run*. A quite satisfactory conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the Common Lisp object system, we take as exercise subject the implementation of such an organization in Common Lisp, using the main components of CLOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes as structured types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *class* is firstly a structured type. Each *instance* (element) of a *standard* class has several *slots* (components, fields, members), and each slot has various properties described in the definition of the class. The *builtin* classes, corresponding to old classical types (integers, symbols, ...), are not standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes are organized in a hierarchical way: a class may be or not a *subclass* of another one, and this defines an *order* between the defined classes. This order must be coherent but in general it is not *total*, that is, for two classes $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_2$, they may or may not be compared. But any class is a subclass of the maximal type~$\\mathcal{A}$, which contains any object, in particular the corresponding class object itself; to prove this point, we assign this class object to the symbol `universe` and verify the object so located is of the type so described; this maximal class $\\mathcal{A}$ corresponds to the set (type) $\\mathcal{A}$ of the previous section."

We therefore need a `subtypep` Lisp function to compare types. If both arguments are discriminant types, the answer is read in a `sup` slot; if both arguments are functional, the appropriate comparisons must be applied to the respective sources and targets; if the types are not of the same nature, one being discriminant and the other one being functional, the answer is certainly negative[<sup>9</sup>](#footnote_9).\n",

A *chain complex* is a graded differential module; an *algebra* is a chain complex with a compatible multiplicative structure, the same for a *coalgebra* but with a comultiplicative[<sup>17</sup>](#footnote_17) structure.

Look at this small example where we construct the second loop space of $S^3$, then the first loop space, and then again the second loop space.

We assume a `C` class, where each `C` object has two slots, `sl1` and `sl2`; the first one is necessary, but the second one would be the result of a *complex* process here simulated as being 1000 times the value of the first one."

The answer, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is quickly obtained, but the number of present Kenzo objects is now 504; an enormous set of `slot-unbound` calls has generated the construction of 478 new Kenzo objects, necessary to do the calculation. Furthermore a `:before` method had been added just to count the number of `slot-unbound` calls, a convenient debugging trick; you see the homology calculation has recursively generated 240 `slot-unbound` calls."

    "\n",
    "Computing time is crucial for the applications of the Kenzo program. The complexity of the implemented algorithms is highly exponential, so that the developer must carefully consider how he can improve the computing time of the written down Lisp code. In particular, if the heart of the program may be written close to the machine language, large amounts of computing time can be saved. But conversely this must not penalize the *readability* and the *modularity* of the program.\n",

    "Which is striking with the current version of Common Lisp is the possibility of easily mixing *low level* and *high level* programming. The features about OOP previously described in this paper show how Common Lisp is powerful in high level programming, allowing the user to directly handle the sophisticated objects of Algebraic Topology such as chain complexes, products and coproducts, Hopf algebras, simplicial sets and simplicial groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "iut on the other hand, the Kenzo program intensively uses the low level part of the Common Lisp language, that is, the quasi-assembler language which is the very root of the language, such as the popular (?) `car`, `cdr`, and `cons`. This is possible thanks to the Common Lisp *macrogenerator*, already mentioned [Section 3.5](#Improvements.). Let us consider the case of the type `absm`, that is, *abstract simplex*. These objects are really the most elementary consituents of the Kenzo geometric  objects, and they are so intensively used, billions of times for every sgnificant Kenzo run, that you *must not* use CLOS for these kernel structures. Kenzo defines the `absm` type as follows:\n",

Most of computations in Algebraic Topology are in fact low level computations about degeneracy\n",
    "operators where such an operator is a decreasing list of small integers, like `(5 2 0)`; because this list is *strictly* decreasing, it can be represented by the fixnum 37 because $37 = 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^0$, so that all the standard calculations about degeneracy operators become fine calculations *at the bit level* on binary fixnums. But Common Lisp has all the\n",
    "predefined functions to do such a job, so that the programmer can efficiently work according to this strategy. A considerable memory space is saved so and furthermore the calculations are much faster.\n",
