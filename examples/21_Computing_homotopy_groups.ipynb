    "# Computing homotopy groups\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used here to compute the homotopy groups is  known as the **Whitehead tower**. We recall some mathematical points:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) The Hurewicz theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem.** *Let X be a 1-connected space such that all its homology groups $H_r(X)$ are null\n",
    "for $0<r<n$, then $\\pi_n(X)\\simeq H_n(X)$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) The properties of the classifying spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ such that $\\pi_r(X)=0$ for $0<r<n$. From now on, we shall denote  $\\pi_n(X)$ simply by $\\pi$.\n",
    "Let us consider the universal coefficients exact sequence:\n",
    "$$ 0 \\longrightarrow Ext(H_{n-1}(X), \\pi) \\longrightarrow H^n(X,\\pi) \\longrightarrow Hom(H_n(X),\\pi) \\longrightarrow 0.$$\n",
    "Here $H_{n-1}(X)=0$, so that a canonical isomorphism is given:\n",
    "$$H^n(X,\\pi) \\buildrel {\\simeq} \\over \\longrightarrow Hom(H_n(X),\\pi),$$\n",
    "but $H_n(X) \\simeq \\pi$ and this gives us a canonical element $h \\in H^n(X, \\pi)$ which is the fundamental $n$-th cohomology class in this context. A cocycle $\\chi$ representing $h$ is constructed as follows. In the chain complex\n",
    "$$ \\cdots  \\rightarrow  C_{n+1}  \\buildrel {d_{n+1}} \\over \\longrightarrow C_n\n",
    "            \\buildrel {d_n} \\over \\longrightarrow  C_{n-1} \\longrightarrow \\cdots,$$\n",
    "the kernel $Z_n$ of $d_n$ is a summand of $C_n(X)$:\n",
    "$$ C_n = Z_n \\oplus S$$\n",
    "and such a decomposition induces a projection $p:C_n(X) \\longrightarrow Z_n$. Finally, we have also the canonical projection $p':Z_n \\longrightarrow H_n=\\pi$. Then, $\\chi$ can be defined by $\\chi = p' \\circ p$ and $\\chi$ *is a cocycle*. If another $p$ is chosen, another $\\chi$ is obtained but the cohomology class is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us fix now a choice for the cocycle $\\chi: C_n(X) \\longrightarrow \\pi$. This cocycle induces in turn a simplicial map:\n",
    "$$ \\varphi_\\chi: C_n(X) \\longrightarrow K(\\pi,n), $$\n",
    "where $K(\\pi,n)$ is the classifying group $K(\\pi_n(X),n)$ of the group $\\pi_n(X)=\\pi$. If $\\chi'$ is another choice for the cocycle then $\\varphi_{\\chi'}$ is homotopic to $\\varphi_\\chi$. We recall that the space $K(\\pi,n)$ has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $H_r(K(\\pi,n))=0$ for $0 < r < n$,\n",
    "2. $\\pi_r(K(\\pi,n))=0$ for $r \\not= n$,\n",
    "3. $\\pi_n(K(\\pi,n))=H_n(K(\\pi,n)= \\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a canonical fibration of base space $K(\\pi, n)$ and fibre space $K(\\pi, n-1)$ is deduced from a canonical twisting operator $$\\tau: K(\\pi, n) \\longrightarrow K(\\pi, n-1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "K(\\pi, n-1)\\cr\n",

    "\\downarrow \\cr\n",
    "K(\\pi,n)\n",
    "\\end{gathered}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if a simplicial map $\\varphi_\\chi: X \\longrightarrow K(\\pi,n)$ is given, it is then possible to construct a fibration of base space $X$ and fibre space $K(\\pi, n-1)$, the twisting operator being then defined by: $\\tau_\\chi = \\tau \\circ \\varphi_\\chi $, according to the diagram:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "### 3) The Serre exact sequence of the homotopy groups of fibrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the fibration\n",
    "$$F \\quad \\hookrightarrow\\quad  T=X \\otimes_\\tau F \\hskip 1.2em \\longrightarrow \\hskip -1.2em \\longrightarrow \\quad X,$$\n",
    "The Serre exact sequence establishes a connection between the homotopy groups of the 3 spaces, in any  dimension:\n",
    "$$\\cdots \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(F) \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(T) \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(X) \\longrightarrow \\pi_n(F) \\longrightarrow$$\n",
    "$$\\longrightarrow  \\pi_n(T) \\longrightarrow \\pi_n(X)  \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n-1}(F) \\longrightarrow \\cdots $$\n",
    "In our special case, where the fibration is:\n",
    "$$K(\\pi, n-1) \\quad \\hookrightarrow\\quad  X' \\hskip 1.2em \\longrightarrow \\hskip -1.2em\\longrightarrow  \\quad X,$$\n",
    "the Serre sequence may be written:\n",
    "$$\\cdots \\longrightarrow  \\pi_{n+1}(K(\\pi, n-1)) \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(X') \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(X) \\longrightarrow $$\n",
    "$$\\longrightarrow \\pi_n(K(\\pi, n-1))\\longrightarrow\\pi_n(X')\\longrightarrow \\pi_n(X)\\longrightarrow \\pi_{n-1}(K(\\pi, n-1)) \\longrightarrow 0.$$\n",
    "But we know that $\\pi_i(K(\\pi,n))=0$ for $i \\not= n$ and that $\\pi_n(K(\\pi, n))=\\pi,$\n",
    "so the exact sequence may be re-written:\n",
    "$$0 \\rightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(X') \\rightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(X) \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow  \\pi_n(X') \\rightarrow \\pi_n(X) \\rightarrow \\pi \\rightarrow 0.$$\n",
    "The subsequence:\n",
    "$$0 \\longrightarrow  \\pi_n(X') \\longrightarrow \\pi_n(X)\\longrightarrow \\pi \\longrightarrow 0.$$\n",
    "is exact; furthermore, the cocycle $\\chi$ is such that the connection morphism\n",
    "$\\partial: \\pi_n(X) \\rightarrow \\pi$ is the identity; so that we deduce that $\\pi_n (X')=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, from the exactness of the subsequence\n",
    "$$0 \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(X') \\longrightarrow \\pi_{n+1}(X) \\longrightarrow 0$$\n",
    "we deduce that $\\pi_{n+1}(X') \\simeq \\pi_{n+1}(X)$ and more generally $\\pi_r(X') \\simeq \\pi_r(X)$ for $r \\not= n.$ In particular, $\\pi_r(X')=0$ for $r \\leq n+1$ and the Hurewicz theorem gives again:\n",
    "$$H_{n+1}(X') \\simeq \\pi_{n+1}(X') \\simeq  \\pi_{n+1}(X).$$\n",
    "So, if we know how to compute $H_{n+1}(X')$ then we  have obtained $\\pi_{n+1}(X).$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) The Whitehead tower\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote for a reason which will be clear in a moment the space $X'$ by $X^{(n+1)}$. Due to the properties of  $X^{(n+1)}$, we may iterate the process, namely, build the following fibrations, where $\\pi_{n+1}(X^{(n+1)})$ is  denoted simply by $\\pi'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "K(\\pi', n)\\qquad\\quad &\\qquad\\buildrel {=} \\over \\longrightarrow  & K(\\pi', n)\\qquad\\quad \\cr\n",
    "\\downarrow\\qquad\\qquad  & & \\downarrow\\qquad\\qquad \\cr\n",
    "X^{(n+2)}=X^{(n+1)} \\times_{\\tau_\\chi} K(\\pi', n) &\\qquad\\buildrel {\\psi_\\chi} \\over \\longrightarrow & \n",

    "   X^{(n+1)}\\qquad\\quad  & \\qquad\\buildrel \\varphi_\\chi \\over \\longrightarrow & K(\\pi',n+1)\\qquad\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X^{(n+2)}= X^{(n+1)} \\times_{\\tau_\\chi} K(\\pi', n)$ has the property\n",
    "$$H_{n+2}(X^{(n+2)}) \\simeq  \\pi_{n+2}(X^{(n+2)}) \\simeq \\pi_{n+2}(X^{(n+1)}) \\simeq \\pi_{n+2}(X). $$\n",
    "This construction is known as the Whitehead tower.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The functions for computing homotopy groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### An important remark\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of Kenzo, only the case where the first non-null homology group (in non-null dimension) is $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/{2 \\mathbb{Z}}$ can be processed; however if this homology group is a direct sum of several copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/{2 \\mathbb{Z}}$, then the corresponding stage of the Whitehead tower may also be constructed step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "`chml-clss` *chcm first* *\\[Function\\]*\n",
    "> Return a \"fundamental\" cohomology class, more precisely a cocycle $\\chi$ defining it. The first argument *chcm* must be a chain complex $C_*$ with effective homology; in particular, an effective chain complex $EC_*$ is a by-product of the machine object $C_*$. The second argument \"*first*\" is an integer $n$, namely the first non-null dimension from which the chain complex *chcm* has a non-null homology group, which {\\bf must be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$} or $\\mathbb{Z}/{2 \\mathbb{Z}}$. The reader may be amazed that this argument \"*first*\" must be provided, since it is a consequence of the given $C_*$. But in fact, the same function `chml-class` may also be used in different contexts, for example, the Postnikov tower; in such a case, the argument *first* is not redundant. The returned cocycle $\\chi$ is in any case a chain complex morphism $\\chi: EC_* \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the unit chain complex created by the function `z-chcm`. The degree of the morphism is $-n$. It is important to note that  the chain complex involved in the source of the morphism is the **effective** chain complex of the homotopy equivalence value of the slot `efhm` of the object *chcm*. See the section *The general method for computing homology* in the Homology chapter. Finally, if $H_n(C_*)=\\mathbb{Z}/{2 \\mathbb{Z}}$, the actual cohomology class hoped by the user is the composition $p \\circ \\chi$, where $p$ is the canonical projection $\\mathbb{Z}\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{Z}/{2\\mathbb{Z}}$. But nevertheless, the `chml-clss` lisp function returns $\\chi$ and not $p \\circ \\chi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`z-whitehead` *smst chml-clss* *\\[Function\\]*\n",
    "> Return a fibration  over the simplicial set *smst* (the first argument), canonically associated to the \"cohomology class\" *chml-clss* (the second argument).

The first non null homotopy group $\\pi_n(X)$ is assumed to be $\\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $\\pi_n(X)= H_n(X)= \\mathbb{Z}$. The previous function `chml-clss`, in this situation, returns a cocycle $\\chi$, which may be used as the second argument *chml-clss* of the function `z-whitehead`. The integer  $n$ is determined by the absolute value of the degree of the cohomology class *chcm-clss*. As explained in the previous section, a canonical fibration is induced by $\\chi$ and it is this fibration which is returned by `z-whitehead`. The slot `sintr` of the fibration is set by the internal function `z-whitehead-sintr` which builds in an efficient way the lisp function implementing the twisting operator $\\tau \\circ \\varphi_\\chi$.\n",

The actual cocycle is obtained by the composition $p \\circ \\chi$, $p$ being the canonical projection $\\mathbb{Z} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/{2 \\mathbb{Z}}$.
