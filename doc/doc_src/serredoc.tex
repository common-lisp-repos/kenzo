\chapter {Serre spectral sequence}

\section {Introduction}

This chapter is devoted to the {\tt Kenzo} implementation of the
Serre spectral sequence\index{Serre spectral sequence}
with the aim to compute the homology groups
of the total  space of a fibration. From the programming point of view,
this method will be used according to our general scheme of searching homology
(generic function {\tt search-efhm}) applied  to an object of type {\tt fibration-total}.

\section {The topological problem}

Let ${\cal G}$ be a simplicial group (the fiber space),  $B$, a $1$--reduced simplicial set (the base space) and
$\tau$ (the fibration), a simplicial morphism of degree $-1$, $\tau: B \longrightarrow {\cal G}$.
We know, from a previous chapter (fibrations) that the software {\tt Kenzo} knows how to build
the total space of the fibration: $B \times_\tau {\cal G}$, which has the same simplices as
$B \times {\cal G}$ and the same face operators except the last one, given by:
$$\partial_n(b,g)  =  (\partial_n b, \tau(b).\partial_n g), \quad b\in B, g \in {\cal G},$$
where the '{\tt .}' denotes the group operation in ${\cal G}$. This discrepancy between the respective face operators
$\partial_n$ induces a discrepancy between the differential operators. We suppose now, that
the base and  fiber  spaces are objects of effective homology type, i.e. there exists homotopy equivalences
$$\diagram{
  & \widehat{B}  & & & & \widehat{\cal G} & & \cr
 \rho_1 \swarrow\nearrow  & & \searrow\nwarrow \rho_2 &\quad & \rho'_1\swarrow\nearrow & & \searrow\nwarrow\rho'_2 & \cr
B  & & EB & & {\cal G}   & & EG \cr
           }$$

where the chain complexes $EB$ and $EG$ are effective. The problem consists in finding a homotopy equivalence
between $B \times_\tau {\cal G}$ and an effective chain complex noted $EB \widetilde{\otimes} EG$;
the underlying graded module of $EB \widetilde{\otimes} EG$ is $EB \otimes EG$ but the differential
is twisted in a rather complicated way. In fact, the chain complex $EB \widetilde{\otimes} EG$ is nothing
but the Hirsh complex\footnote{{\bf Guy Hirsh.} {\em Sur les groupes d'homologie des espaces fibr\'es},
Bulletin de la Soci\'et\'e Math\'ematique de Belgique, 1954, vol. 6, pp. 79-96.}.

\subsection {The Ronald Brown reduction}

We start from the Eilenberg-Zilber reduction  (built in {\tt Kenzo} by the function {\tt ez}).
$$
\diagram{
{{\cal C}_*(B \times {\cal G})} & \stackrel{h}{\longrightarrow} & {}^s{{\cal C}_*(B \times {\cal G})} \cr
 {\scriptstyle f} \downarrow \uparrow {\scriptstyle g}  \cr
 {{\cal C}_*(B) \otimes {\cal C}_*({\cal G})} \cr
}.
$$
But, in fact we are interested in the following one (the Ronald Brown reduction):
$$
\diagram{
{{\cal C}_*(B \times_\tau {\cal G})} & \stackrel{h}{\longrightarrow} & {}^s{{\cal C}_*(B \times_\tau {\cal G})} \cr
 {\scriptstyle f} \downarrow \uparrow {\scriptstyle g}  \cr
 {{\cal C}_*(B) \otimes_t {\cal C}_*({\cal G})} \cr
}
$$
where the symbol $\otimes_t$ represents a {\rm twisted tensor product}, induced by the twisting
operator $\tau$; this twisting operator is nothing but the  Shih twisting cochain\footnote{{\bf Gugenheim.},
  {\em On the chain complex of a fibration}.
   Illinois Journal of Mathematics, 1972, vol. 16, pp. 398-414. } determined by Szczarba\footnote
{{\bf R. H. Szczarba.}
  {\em The homology of twisted cartesian products}.
   Transactions of the American Mathematical Society,
   1961, vol. 100, pp. 197-216.}. Here, to obtain the Szczarba cochain, we apply the perturbation lemma (Ronnie Brown).
In effect, writing
$$ d_\tau = d + (d_\tau -d),$$
one may consider that the differential $d_\tau$ of $B \times_\tau {\cal G}$
is the differential $d$ of $B \times {\cal G}$ modified by the perturbation $d_\tau - d$.
The perturbation morphism $d_\tau -d$ is deduced from the  difference  between both  $\partial_n$ face operators.
This being done,  a perturbation may possibly be
propagated along the Eilenberg-Zilber reduction  (see the method {\tt add} applied to a reduction)
and  the perturbation lemma  gives also, as a bonus, the perturbation to be applied to the dif\-fe\-ren\-ti\-al
of $B \otimes {\cal G}$  to obtain the differential of $B \otimes_t {\cal G}$.

\subsection {The Gugenheim algorithm}

On the other hand, from the homotopy equivalences
$$\diagram{
  & \widehat{B} & & & & \widehat{\cal G} & & \cr
 \rho_1 \swarrow\nearrow  & & \searrow\nwarrow \rho_2 &\quad & \rho'_1\swarrow\nearrow & & \searrow\nwarrow\rho'_2 & \cr
B  & & EB & & {\cal G}   & & EG \cr
           }$$
it is possible to build their tensor product, i.e. the   homotopy equivalence:
$$\diagram{
  & \widehat{B}\otimes \widehat{\cal G} &    \cr
 \swarrow\nearrow & & \searrow\nwarrow \cr
B\otimes {\cal G}  & & EB \otimes EG \cr}
$$
This is done in {\tt Kenzo} by the method  {\tt tnsr-prdc}.
In fact, we are interested in the following one:
$$\diagram{
  & \widehat{B}\widetilde{\otimes}\widehat{\cal G} &    \cr
 \swarrow\nearrow & & \searrow\nwarrow \cr
B\otimes_t {\cal G}  & & EB \widetilde{\otimes} EG \cr}
$$
where $\widehat{B}\widetilde{\otimes}\widehat{\cal G}$ and $EB \widetilde{\otimes} EG$ are appropriate
strongly twisted tensor products determined by the perturbation lemma: this last homotopy equivalence
is obtained by propagating over the previous one, the perturbation to be applied to the differential
of $B \otimes {\cal G}$  to obtain the differential of $B \otimes_t {\cal G}$.
The homotopy equivalence so obtained is called in {\tt Kenzo} the {\em right Serre homotopy equivalence}.

\subsection {Assembling the puzzle}

Let us build now the so-called {\em left Serre homotopy equivalence},
$$\diagram{
  & B\times_\tau{\cal G} &    \cr
 \swarrow\nearrow & & \searrow\nwarrow \cr
B\times_\tau {\cal G}  & & B\otimes_t {\cal G} \cr}
$$
where the left reduction is the trivial one and the right reduction is
the Brown reduction. We may then compose both Serre homotopy equivalences to obtain
what we were looking for:
$$\diagram{
  & B\times_\tau {\cal G}  & & &\widehat{B}\otimes_t\widehat{\cal G} & & \cr
 \rho_1 \swarrow\nearrow  & & \searrow\nwarrow \rho_2 & \rho'_1\swarrow\nearrow & & \searrow\nwarrow\rho'_2 & \cr
B\times_\tau {\cal G}  & &B\otimes_t {\cal G} &B\otimes_t {\cal G} & &EB \otimes_t EG \cr
           }$$

\section {The functions for the Serre spectral sequence}

The following functions are given for information purpose.

{\parindent=0mm
{\leftskip=5mm
{\tt fibration-dtau-d-intr} {\em fibration}  \hfill {\em [Function]} \par}
{\leftskip=15mm
Build the lisp function corresponding to the difference $d_\tau - d$, where $d$ is the differential
in $B \times {\cal G}$ and $d_\tau$ the differential in $B \times_\tau {\cal G}$. This is an internal
function and is used in the following one. \par}
{\leftskip=5mm
{\tt fibration-dtau-d} {\em fibration}  \hfill {\em [Function]} \par}
{\leftskip=15mm
Build the morphism $d_\tau-d$, which is the perturbation morphism to be added to
the differential  $d$ of $B \times {\cal G}$  to obtain  $d_\tau$,
the differential in $B \times_\tau {\cal G}$. We recall that both simplicial sets have
the same simplices. The source and the target of this morphism is the total space
$B \times_\tau {\cal G}$ and the degree is $-1$. \par}
{\leftskip=5mm
{\tt Brown-reduction} {\em fibration}  \hfill {\em [Function]} \par}
{\leftskip=15mm
Return two values: a) the Brown reduction and b) the  perturbation to be applied to the differential of the tensor
product $B \otimes {\cal G}$  to obtain the differential of the twisted tensor
product $B \otimes_t {\cal G}$. \par}

\section {Searching homology for fibration total spaces}

The comment list of a {\tt Kenzo} object which is the total space of a fibration has the form
\index{searching homology!fibration total space}
{\tt (fibration-total {\em fibration})}. The {\tt search-efhm} method applied to a simplicial
set having this kind of comment list, builds the composition of the left and right Serre homotopy
equivalences. The right one needs the homotopy equivalences attached respectively to the
base and  fiber spaces. This may involve a recursive call of {\tt search-efhm}.
If the base space or the fiber space
are locally effective, the total space is locally effective and the method
cannot compute the homology.
{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
(defmethod SEARCH-EFHM (smst (orgn (eql 'fibration-total)))
  (declare
     (type simplicial-set smst))
  (the homotopy-equivalence
     (fibration-total-efhm (second (orgn smst)))))

(defun FIBRATION-TOTAL-EFHM (fibration)
  (declare (type fibration fibration))
  (the homotopy-equivalence
       (cmps (left-serre-efhm fibration)
             (right-serre-efhm fibration))))
\end{verbatim}}

\subsection* {Examples}

We begin by some examples similar to examples that we have seen in the fibrations chapter.
For the user, the delicate point is to write in Lisp a correct twisting operator. There is no check
in this version of {\tt Kenzo} for the coherency of the twisting operator. In the first example
we define a fibration $\tau: S^2 \rightarrow K(\Z,1)$ with $\tau(s2)= (2)$, then we build the
total space of the fibration, namely $P^3{\R}$, and we compute some known homology groups.

Using the last total space ({\tt total-17}), it is instructive to enter in the details
of the resulting homotopy equivalence that the system builds to compute the homology
groups. First, the function {\tt echcm} selects the {\bf effective} chain complex of the homotopy
equivalence, value of the slot {\tt efhm} of the simplicial set {\tt total-17}, and we may
print some basis of this chain complex. In fact, all basis in dimension above $3$ are null.
The presence of the symbol {\tt S1} is due to the fact that the effective chain complex
used for the homology of $K(\Z,1)$ is the circle (see the classifying spaces chapter).

The resulting homotopy equivalence built by the system, may be summarized
by the diagram:

$$\diagram{
  &\widehat{S^2\times_\tau K(\Z,1)} &    \cr
 f\swarrow\nearrow & & \searrow\nwarrow g \cr
S^2\times_\tau K(\Z,1) & & [K205\, Chain\, Complex] \cr}
$$

where {\em f} and {\em g} are respectively the {\em descending} and {\em ascending}
morphisms of the left and right reductions of the homotopy equivalence. We recall that
these morphisms are obtained respectively by the functions {\tt lf} and {\tt rg}. We may
compose these morphisms to create a morphism {\tt fg} from $[K205]$ to $S^2\times_\tau K(\Z,1)$ and
see how it acts on the basis  elements in dimension $1$ and $2$:
